# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play against the computer.

## How to Play

1. The game board is displayed as a 3x3 grid with numbers 1-9 representing available positions.
2. You play as 'O' and the computer plays as 'X'.
3. On your turn, enter the number corresponding to the position where you want to place your 'O'.
4. The computer will automatically make its move as 'X' after your turn.
5. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
6. If all positions are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
